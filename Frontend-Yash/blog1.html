               Nutrients are essential substances that our bodies need to grow, repair, and function properly. They provide
               us with energy, build and maintain tissues, and support various bodily processes.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are six major classes of nutrients:
            <br><br>
           <b>
             1) Carbohydrates </b>: These provide the primary source of energy for our bodies. They are found in grains,
            fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.
            <br>
            <br>
           <b>2) Proteins</b>: Essential for building and repairing tissues, proteins are found in meat, poultry, fish, eggs,
            beans, and nuts.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>3) Fats</b>: While often associated with unhealthy eating, healthy fats are essential for energy, hormone
            production, and cell function. They are found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds.
            <br>
            <br>
           <b>4) Vitamins</b>: These are organic compounds that our bodies need in small amounts. They help regulate various
            bodily functions. Examples include Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B12.
            <br>
            <br>
           <b>5) Minerals</b> : Inorganic substances that our bodies need in small amounts, minerals help with bone health,
            nerve function, and fluid balance. Examples include calcium, iron, and potassium.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>6) Water</b>: While not technically a nutrient, water is essential for all bodily functions. It helps regulate
            temperature, transport nutrients, and eliminate waste.
